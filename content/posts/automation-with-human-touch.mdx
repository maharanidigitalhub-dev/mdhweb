Automation works best when it protects time for meaningful human moments.

## Map the full journey

List every onboarding, delivery, and reporting touchpoint. Mark where empathy matters most and automate the rest.

## Build simple rules first

Start with clear triggers and notifications. Avoid over engineering early workflows.

## Measure quality, not only speed

Track completion rates, response quality, and client satisfaction alongside time saved.
